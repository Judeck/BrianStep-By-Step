# Brian Step-By-Step
Step-by-Step Brian Simulation
    
This class was created to make it easier to run a Brian simulation step-by-step, passing input spikes without running out of memory or having to create the input spikes beforehand. It also makes the code more clear because you generate a separated function with your Brian simulation code.
    
This code was tested with Brian 1.4 only!
